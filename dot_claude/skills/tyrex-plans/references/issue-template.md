# Context

<!-- Background for this issue. Answer:
     - What problem does this solve or what feature does it add?
     - If part of an epic: summarize the relevant epic context and
       technical decisions that affect this issue.
     - Link to the GitLab issue. -->

# Objective

<!-- One clear, testable statement of what this issue achieves.
     Example: "Host detects a 64 MB USB drive named T-SCANNER with
     one dummy file. Read and write to that file work." -->

# Plan

## 1. Substep title

<!-- Each substep must be specific enough to implement without guessing.
     Include code sketches for non-obvious APIs.
     Reference existing code to modify (file:line when possible).
     Each substep becomes one jj changeset during implementation. -->

## 2. Substep title

# Files Modified

| File   | Action | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|

# Testing

<!-- Specific, verifiable criteria. Include:
     - Commands to run and expected output
     - Manual test steps if applicable
     - Edge cases to verify -->

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

# Risks

<!-- What could go wrong and how to mitigate.
     Consider: memory budget, performance, backward compat, blocking deps. -->

- Risk 1 -> mitigation

# Notes

<!-- Updated during implementation: progress, blockers, decisions made.
     This section serves as the progress tracker for /tyrex-plan:implement.
     Completed substeps are marked here when resuming after interruption. -->
